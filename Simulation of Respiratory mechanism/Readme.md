# Respiratory Mechanics Simulation Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains an analysis of respiratory mechanics simulation using the tool developed by David Leonardo Rodriguez Sarmiento and Daniela Acevedo Guerrero (2020). The simulation enables the study of various respiratory conditions in adults, including normal, restrictive pulmonary disease, and obstructive pulmonary disease scenarios. The simulator provides graphical representations of ventilation patterns and allows for a comparison of minute ventilation across different ventilator settings.

## Simulation Tool

The simulation tool used in this analysis is a GUI-based application developed on Simulink. The simulator is available at [Simulation of Respiratory Mechanics on Simulink with GUI](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/75335-simulation-of-respiratory-mechanics-on-simulink-with-gui).


## Normal Respiratory Scenario 
   - In a healthy individual, the lungs and chest wall work together to create normal breathing patterns. The diaphragm contracts to expand the thoracic cavity, reducing pressure in the lungs and allowing air to flow in.
   - Here simulate these normal mechanics using the tool to understand the baseline ventilation patterns and minute ventilation.
   - Record minute ventilation, which is the total volume of air entering or leaving the lungs per minute.

## Restrictive Pulmonary Disease Scenario
   - Restrictive pulmonary diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis or sarcoidosis, result in reduced lung compliance. This means the lungs are stiffer and require more effort to expand.
   - Here we model the mechanics of a lung with decreased compliance, reflecting the difficulty in expanding the lungs.
   - Capture the reduced lung expansion and altered ventilation patterns.
   - Record minute ventilation to observe how it is affected by the restrictive nature of the disease.

## Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Scenario
   - Diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, course to increased airway resistance. This makes it harder for air to flow out of the lungs, causing air trapping and hyperinflation.
   - Here we set the model parameters to simulate  the mechanics of breathing with increased airway resistance. Explore the prolonged expiratory phases, reduced peak expiratory flow rates, and possible air trapping.
   - Report explaons the how the disease impacts overall airflow and ventilation efficiency.

## Comparison 
1. **Minute ventilation**  is a key indicator of respiratory efficiency and adequacy. Comparing it across different scenarios helps highlight how various pulmonary conditions impact overall ventilation.

2. Different pulmonary diseases affect the shape and nature of the ventilation pattern. Restrictive diseases often result in rapid, shallow breathing, while obstructive diseases lead to prolonged, labored exhalation.
