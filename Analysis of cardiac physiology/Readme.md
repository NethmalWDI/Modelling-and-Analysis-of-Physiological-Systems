# Respiratory Mechanics Simulation Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of cardiac physiological systems using simulation software. The analysis focuses on various aspects of normal cardiac functioning and the effects of aortic valve stenosis. The simulation software provides visual representations of left ventricular pressure, left atrial pressure, aortic pressure, left ventricular volume, blood flow velocities in the aortic and mitral valves, and pressure-volume relations of the left ventricle.


## Acknowledgments
The analysis was performed using the simulation software CircAdapt. Example videos like (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO6B9Q3At1Y) helped understand Bernoulli's equation and its application in the circulatory system.

## Disclaimer
This analysis is based on simulations and educational resources. It should not replace medical advice or professional consultation. The purpose is solely educational and exploratory
